# Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization (MMSO) Repository

## Overview
Welcome to my repository for the **Mathematical Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization (MMSO)** degree. This repository contains all my coursework, projects, and research implementations related to MMSO. It serves as a collection of code, mathematical models, and simulations that I have developed during my studies.

## Contents
This repository includes:
- **Coursework Assignments**: Implementations of algorithms and mathematical models learned in the MMSO program.
- **Projects**: Various projects focusing on optimization, PDEs, FEM, and simulations.
- **Thesis Work**: Still in development. 
- **Experiments & Research**: Exploration of mathematical techniques and computational methods.

## Key Topics Covered
- **Optimization Algorithms** (Linear, Nonlinear, Convex, Integer Programming)
- **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** and their numerical solutions
- **Route Optimization** and other applied mathematical models

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, PyTorch, etc.)
- **C++** (where performance optimization is needed)
- **Visual Studio Code** for development

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mmso-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant directory and run the code according to the provided instructions.

## Future Plans
- Enhance simulation visualization 
- Implement more real-world case studies
- Improve code efficiency and documentation
